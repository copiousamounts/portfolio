            <p>My name is Nick Hernstedt and I am an aspiring full stack developer. I have always loved to learn new things and have always enjoyed spending time on my computer. As a result I came to the decision that a career in computer programing would be the perfect fit for me. </p>

            <p>However, I needed to aquire a very specific set of skill in order to make that transition.</p>

            <p>As a result I decided to attend the UC Davis Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp, where I learned skills such as HTML, CSS, Javascript and Jquery.</p>

            <p>After finishing the bootcamp I intend to find a job that I can make use of the many skills that I have learned as well as contiune to grow as a programmer</p>
